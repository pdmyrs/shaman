Java networking with no dependencies

This was created when we were trouble shooting Clay Tablet Connector
It is based on the AWS ShaTest, https://www.amazonsha256.com/shaTest.zip
Clay Tablet added alot of useful stuff. That's why it is called myShaTest

Usage: 

$ /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_76/bin/javac ShaTest.java
$ /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_76/jre/bin/java ShaTest
